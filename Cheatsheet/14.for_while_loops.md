# Loops in Python (for and while)

## Introduction

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

## For Loop

The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

**Syntax:**

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
```

**Example:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

In this example, the loop iterates over the "fruits" list, and in each iteration, the "fruit" variable takes on the value of the current item in the list.

#### While Loop

The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run.

**Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
```

**Example:**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, the "while" loop continues to execute as long as the "count" is less than 5. The "count" variable is incremented in each iteration.

# Loop Control Statements (break and continue)

## Introduction

Loop control statements are used to modify the behavior of loops, providing greater control and flexibility during iteration. In Python, two primary loop control statements are "break" and "continue."

## `break` Statement

The "break" statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. It can be applied to both "for" and "while" loops, allowing you to terminate the loop when a particular condition is met.

**Example:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        break
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
```

In this example, the loop stops when it encounters the number 3.

## `continue` Statement

The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next one. It can be used in both "for" and "while" loops, enabling you to bypass certain iterations based on a condition.

**Example:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
4
5
```

In this example, the loop skips the iteration where the number is 3 and continues with the next iteration.

## Practice Exercise - Automating Log File Analysis

#### Introduction

In this practice exercise, we use a "for" loop to automate the analysis of a log file and identify lines containing the word "error." This demonstrates how loops can be used to process data and extract relevant information efficiently.

**Example:**

```python
log_file = [
   "INFO: Operation successful",
   "ERROR: File not found",
   "DEBUG: Connection established",
   "ERROR: Database connection failed",
]

for line in log_file:
   if "ERROR" in line:
       print(line)
```

**Output:**

```
ERROR: File not found
ERROR: Database connection failed
```

In this exercise, the loop iterates through the "log_file" list and prints lines containing the word "ERROR."
